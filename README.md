Flask-Server-Session
=============

Flask-Server-Session is an extension for Flask that adds support for server-sided-sessions in your application.

Currently we only support filesystem and MongoDB.

A documentation is in the works.
This is a fork of Flask-Session, however a lot has changed, please do not refer to their documentation at this time.
